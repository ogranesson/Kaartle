# Kaartle

From **kaart** (map in Dutch) + **-le**, from [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). (because Worldle was taken, and Bordle sounds weird.)
The aim is to make a game where you guess the country only through its outline.
This README file will be properly updated soon, I hope.
